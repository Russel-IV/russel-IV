- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Russel Guevara

I am currently working on what I consider my most important project: SIGO. It is an oncology management system focused on compliance with GES guarantees and Chilean regulations.
SIGO was created in response to the need to digitize the process that a cancer patient undergoes in Chile. It was made with Spring Boot, Java, and React.
You can check it out in the 'SIGO' repository.
