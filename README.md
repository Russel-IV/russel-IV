- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Russel Guevara
- Here you can find my projects; currently working on SIGO:

I am currently working on what I consider my most important project: SIGO.
SIGO was created in response to the need to digitize the process that a cancer patient undergoes in Chile. It is an oncology management system focused on compliance with GES guarantees and Chilean regulations. Made with Spring Boot, Java, and React.
